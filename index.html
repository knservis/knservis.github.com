        <h3>Personal information.</h3>

<p>My name is Konstantinos N. Servis (actually Κωνσταντίνος-Στυλιανός Ν. Σέρβης in Greek) by usually just Kosta for short, and this is a page with some information about myself and my professional and personal interests.</p>

<h3>Contact details</h3>

<p>You can contact me on <a href="mailto:wrong_address,_you_need_javascript_for_the_right_one@knserv.is" id="my_email">my email</a> and you can message me through skype, and gtalk. My username in those online services is the same as this domain (knservis). You can also find me on <a href="https://plus.google.com/114551496925680818112">g+</a>, <a href="http://au.linkedin.com/in/knservis">linkedIn</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/knservis">fb</a>.</p>

<h3>Computing as profession</h3>

<p>Currently I am employed as a Senior Software Developer at InnoGames GmbH in Hamburg, Germany until June 2014 when I will be returning to Australia. I have had the opportunity to learn a lot of new technologies and expand on previous knowledge on this role. Most importantly I had the opportunity to use Hadoop, Hive, Storm, Java and Scala. The company allows employees some time for personal development and own projects, and I used that time, among other things to take Martin Odersky's coursera courses "Founamentals of Functional Programming with Scala" and "Reactive Programming with Scala".</p>

<p>Previously I was employed as a Software Developer at HIE, Brisbane. My duties involved maintaining and improving a number of web applications replated to the Australian national eHealth record that the company is deploying. The deployment platform is Sinatra, the OS is Linux, the main programming  language used is Ruby and it is all provisioned using Chef. In my job I try to use the best practices that I know of such as Test and Behaviour Driven Development without becoming religious about them. I try to avoid reinventing the wheel and try to dissuade others form doing so, as I think that in general one is best off using code that others have written, tested and are using, when possible. If there are issues with an OS library I am using I try to submit a patch.</p>

<p>My main interests are web information systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Most of my professional experience is in web development and most of the courses I have studied had something to do with machine learning and related areas such as data mining and AI in general. Apart from uni courses I have found Andrew Ng's "Machine Learning" coursera course exceptional and Peter Norvig's and Sebastian Thrun's "AI" coursera course really useful. Some pages or web applications that I have helped create or have created are: <a href="http://www.mirrabooka.com">http://www.mirrabooka.com</a>, <a href="http://www.zentro.com.au">http://www.zentro.com.au</a>, <a href="https://myapnic.net">https://myapnic.net</a> (users only).  </p>

<h3>Computing as an interest</h3>

<p>It has been nearly 20 years since I first saw Linux (after some enlightened admin named "farmer" mentioned it to me on the matrix.kapatel.gr BBS over 24k modem) and almost 10 since I stopped using Windows as my main platform (There is currently a couple of partitions on my computers that contain Windows which I occasionally boot, mainly for games). I have always really liked the idea of open source software, Linux and the romantic ideals that go with it and I try to follow the evolution of OS projects. </p>

<p>Like many people who have an interest in computing, I have a few toy projects. Some things I currently like to spend my free time in are Image processing courses on coursera. Previously I have looked into Starcraft AI agents, reading and reimplementing the code in the "Computational Beauty of Nature" by Garry William Flake, which is one of the most enjoyable books I have, but my list of things to attempt given time, is already 24 items long :-)</p>

<h3>Other interests</h3>

<p>Traveling, hiking and sailing are things I have been lucky enough to participate in and photograph and I am sure I will do again. I have done approximately 15 dives around Australia the last few years and I am planning to continue in the future. I take part in as much sport as time and opportunity allows, so over the last few years I played basketball once a week for a couple of years, I did Taekwondo for 6 years and Hapkido for 3. One thing which I also enjoy very much is reading non-technical books, mostly SciFi, Historical Novels, Fantasy and popular philosophy.</p>
