My username is the same as this domain. You can also find me on [g+](https://plus.google.com/114551496925680818112), [linkedIn] (http://au.linkedin.com/in/knservis) and [fb] (http://www.facebook.com/knservis).\r\n\r\n### Computing as profession\r\nCurrently I am employed as a Software Developer at HIE. My duties involve maintaining and improving a number of web applications that the company is deploying. The deployment platform is Linux and the main language used is Ruby. In my job I try to use the best practices that I know of such as Test and Behaviour Driven Development without becoming religious about them. I try to avoid reinventing the wheel and try to dissuade others form doing so, as I think that in general one is best off using code that others have written, tested and are using. If there are issues with the library you are using, submit a patch!\r\n\r\nMy main interests are web information systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Most of my professional experience is in web development and most of the courses I have studied had something to do with machine learning and related areas such as data mining and AI in general. Some pages or web applications that I have helped create or have created are: http://www.mirrabooka.com, http://www.zentro.com.au, https://myapnic.net (users only).  \r\n\r\n### Computing as an interest\r\nIt has been nearly 20 years since I first saw Linux (after some enlightened admin named \"farmer\" mentioned it to me on the matrix.kapatel.gr BBS over 24k modem) and almost 10 since I stopped using Windows as my main platform (There is currently a couple of partitions on my computers that contain Windows which I occasionally boot, mainly for games). I have always really liked the idea of open source software, Linux and the romantic ideals that go with it and I try to follow the most important projects such as Linux to understand how they do things. \r\n\r\nAs many people who have an interest in computing I have a few toy projects. Some things I currently like to spend my free time in are Starcraft AI agents, reading and reimplementing the code in the \"Computational Beauty of Nature\" but my list of things to attempt given time, is already 24 items long :-)\r\n\r\n### Other interests\r\nTraveling, hiking and sailing are things I have been lucky enough to participate in and photograph and I am sure I will do again. I have done approximately 15 dives around Australia the last few years and I am planning to continue in the future. I take part in as much sport as time and opportunity allows, so over the last few years I played basketball once a week of a couple of years, I did Taekwondo for 6 years and Hapkido for 3. One thing I haven't done enough lately is read non-technical books which I also enjoy very much.\r\n ","tagline":"Craving for code bliss"}
